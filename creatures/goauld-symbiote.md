## Notes

* Based on Venomous Snakes (_see_ HSB 484)
* Possession based on the same ability from various in HSB (as an example _see_ HSB 282) except where the ability in HSB is designed as a _Constant_ power (_see_ 6E1 127), the nature of Goa'uld possession is intended to be more permanent. Because of this, Goa'uld possession is designed as a _Persistent_ power (_see_ 6E1 128).
