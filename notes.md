# Campaign Notes

I think I've always wanted to do a Stargate role play campaign because the setting reminds me of the original X-COM video game. In the beginning, the alien threat seems invincible and insurmountable. But step-by-step, adventure-by-adventure, the heroes grow in knowledge, capability, and power, until eventually they equal and perhaps even surpass the invaders.

## Quirks

### Language

One of the quirks of the television series, which these resources are largely based upon, is that while there are native language terms sprinkled here and there, everyone speaks and understands modern English. This is something that the campaign will maintain.
