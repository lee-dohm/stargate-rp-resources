## Notes

* Knowledge of Goa'uld technology doesn't convey the ability to create new applications of that technology, only the basic understanding of the concepts and what is possible with Goa'uld tech. To create a Goa'uld that understands how to create new technologies, purchase a separate `SS: Goa'uld technology`
* `Language: Goa'uld` is part of the Everyman skills for zero points
