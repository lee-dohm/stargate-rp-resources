# Alien Technology

## Control Crystals

Control crystals are crystals designed to regulate various functions in advanced technology. Most spacefaring races make use of crystal technology in some form.

## Naquadah

[Naquadah](http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Naquadah) is the super-dense mineral that not only makes stargate travel possible but underlies almost all advanced technology in the Stargate universe. It comes in several forms:

* **Raw Naquadah** &mdash; Unprocessed naquadah that must be purified to be used
* **Refined Naquadah** &mdash; Basic usable naquadah
* **Liquid Naquadah** &mdash; Liquified naquadah used in some smaller cells mostly to power weapons such as the [Staff Weapon](#staff-weapon)
* **Heavy Liquid Naquadah** &mdash; Concentrated liquid naquadah used in larger weapons
* **Weapons-grade Naquadah** &mdash; Naquadah in its purest form
* **Naquadria** &mdash; A radioactive form of naquadah that can be used as an enormous power source but is highly unstable

Naquadah is also found in the bloodstream of Goa'uld symbiotes and their hosts. When microscopic amounts of naquadah are infused into the bloodstream of a living organism, coupled with their bioelectric field, those organisms are able to detect nearby concentrations of naquadah. This can include being able to sense other Goa'uld, hosts, Jaffa, Stargates, or other concentrations of the mineral.

## Stargates and the Stargate System

Stargates, also called _chaapa'ai_ in the language of the natives kidnapped by the Goa'uld from Earth, provide point-to-point near-instantaneous faster-than-light travel, typically between two worlds. Any stargate can connect to any other stargate so long as there is sufficient power available and one knows the address of the destination gate. It does this by creating a stable wormhole that will allow matter to pass only from the source gate to the destination gate but will allow electromagnetism, gravity, and possibly other forms of energy to flow both directions.

> **Note:** This bi-directional flow of energy allows for communications to flow both ways no matter who initiates the stargate connection.

For the details on gate addresses and their possible combinations, see [Gate Addresses](stargate-addresses.md).

Activating a gate is a complex process that is made accessible by a dialing computer or DHD (Dial Home Device) in the field. Activating a gate manually by physically moving the inner ring is laborious. Dialing a gate address in this manner takes at least five minutes if it can be done at all. Additionally, it is a very energy-intensive process. The gate has to be charged with energy before it will activate. Fortunately, DHDs have a self-regenerating power source within them sufficient to power a gate for millennia of use.

**Stargate:** Teleportation 100m, x32 Increased Mass; Area Of Effect (4m Radius; +1/4\*), Usable By Other (+1/4), Constant (+1/2), MegaScale (1m = 1,000 lightyears; +5) (875 Active Points); OAF Immobile (-2), Extra Time (1 Turn (Post-Segment 12), -1 1/4), Gate (6E1 301; -1/2), Can only travel to other Stargates (-1/2) (Real Cost: 167) **plus** END Reserve (87 END, 0 REC) (Real Cost: 22) &mdash; **Active Cost:** 897, **Real Cost:** 189

**DHD:** END Reserve (87 END, 87 REC); OAF Bulky (-1 1/2) &mdash; **Active Cost:** 80, **Real Cost:** 67

### Transport Rings

Transport rings are a short-range version of the stargate technology. Their range is enough to go from a planet's surface into orbit or from one starship to another in relative proximity.

**Transport Rings:** Teleportation 100m, x8 Increased Mass; Area Of Effect (2m Radius; +1/4\*), Usable By Other (+1/4), Constant (+1/2), MegaScale (1m = 1,000 km; +1 3/4); OIF Immobile (-1 1/2), Gate (-1/2) &mdash; **Active Cost:** 431, **Real Cost:** 144

## Starships

### Alkesh

**See also:** [Lexicon: Alkesh](http://www.rdanderson.com/stargate/lexicon/entries/alkesh.htm)

An alkesh is a Goa'uld mid-range bomber capable of hyperspace travel and equipped with a ring transporter and cloaking capabilities. Able to attack a Goa'uld mothership because of its speed and maneuverability, it is less maneuverable than a death glider, but superior in size and armaments. Often used by the Goa'uld for aerial attacks, the alkesh can also carry vast armies for ground assaults.

### Death Glider

**See also:** [Lexicon: Death Glider](http://www.rdanderson.com/stargate/lexicon/entries/deathglider.htm)

The Goa'uld death glider is a two-seater attack vessel which usually launches from a larger mothership and is highly maneuverable. Death gliders are used in aerial assaults of a planet's surface as well as against other spacecraft.

### Ha'tak

**See also:** [Lexicon: Ha'tak](http://www.rdanderson.com/stargate/lexicon/entries/hatak.htm)

The Goa'uld ha'tak class vessel, or pyramid ship, is an attack vessel, also referred to as a mothership. It is capable of hyperdrive at many times the speed of light, is heavily armed, shielded, large enough to carry thousands of warriors and to launch a legion of death gliders against the enemy, and capable of destroying a planet from space.

### Teltac

**See also:** [Lexicon: Teltac](http://www.rdanderson.com/stargate/lexicon/entries/teltac.htm)

A teltac is a cargo ship, sometimes referred to as a scout ship, often used by the Goa'uld, the Jaffa, and the Tok'ra. Capable of traveling in hyperspace, most are equipped with cloaking technology, transport rings, and descent pods. Teltacs are maneuverable because of their size, however they are not armed with weapons since they are used primarily as transport vessels.

## Weapons

### Goa'uld Weapons

All Goa'uld weapons have the following modifiers:

* **Focus:** OAF, Universal _see_ 6E1 376
* **STR Minimum** _see_ 6E2 199
* **Real Weapon** _see_ 6E2 200-201, which also makes them susceptible to firearms malfunction rules, _see_ 6E2 207
* **Beam** _see_ 6E1 145

#### Shock Grenade

**See also:** [Lexicon: Shock Grenade](http://www.rdanderson.com/stargate/lexicon/entries/shockgrenade.htm)

#### Staff Weapon

**See also:** [Lexicon: Staff Weapon](http://www.rdanderson.com/stargate/lexicon/entries/staffweapon.htm)

The Goa'uld staff weapon is the preferred weapon of Jaffa warriors. It uses a liquid naquadah power source and fires an energy blast, the power of which is variable depending on factors such as the time allowed for recycling between shots. It is a weapon of great power and endurance, but less accurate than Earth weapons.

**Staff Weapon:** 3d6 RKA, +1 STUNx, Two-Handed, STR Min 13, -1 RMod, Limited Range (60m), 4 shots per Turn (due to liquid naquadah battery)

* RKA 3d6; +1 Increased STUN Multiplier (+1/4); Beam (-1/4), OAF (-1), Real Weapon (-1/4), Limited Range 60m (-1/4), Required Hands 2H (-1/2), STR Min 13 (Cannot Add/Subtract Damage; -1), -1 Range Mod, Side Effect occurs automatically whenever Power is used (-1/2) &mdash; **Active Cost:** 56, **Real Cost:** 12
* **Liquid Naquadah Battery:** END Reserve (24 END, 24 REC); OAF (-1), Linked to RKA (-1/4) &mdash; **Active Cost:** 22, **Real Cost:** 10

#### Zat'nik'tel (aka Zat Gun or Zat)

**See also:** [Lexicon: Zat'nik'tel](http://www.rdanderson.com/stargate/lexicon/entries/zatniktel.htm)

## Goa'uld Devices

While all of the technology so far has been utilized or provided by the [Goa'uld](people.md#goauld), these are the devices that they restrict to their own use.

### Hand Device

All Goa'uld wear a hand device at virtually all times. It serves as an interface to other Goa'uld technology, a weapon, a shield, and probably other functions. Fortunately, the hand device can only serve one function at a time.

* **Goa'uld Hand Device:** Multipower, 60-point reserve; all slots OIF (-1/2), all slots Fixed
* 1\) **Force Field:** Resistant Protection (16 PD/16 ED) (Protect Carried Items); OIF (-1/2), Nonpersistent (-1/4)
* 2\) **Brain Melty Thing:** Hand-To-Hand Attack +3d6, Reduced Endurance (0 END; +1/2), Does BODY (+1), Attack Versus Alternate Defense (Mental Defense; +1 1/2); OIF (-1/2), Hand-To-Hand Attack (-1/4)
* 3\) **Force Blast:** Blast 8d6, Reduced Endurance (0 END; +1/2); OIF (-1/2)

### Healing Device

### Sarcophagus

A Goa'uld Sarcophagus is a technology that can heal any wound and even bring humans and Jaffa back from the dead. It does have one major downside, however, in that it causes megalomania in anyone who uses it over an extended period.

**Sarcophagus:**

* Healing BODY 4d6, Can Heal Limbs, Resurrection, Decreased Re-use Duration (1 Hour; +1/2) (97 Active Points); Extra Time (20 Minutes, Character May Take No Other Actions, -2 3/4), OAF Immobile Durable Expendable (Difficult to obtain new Focus; -2 1/4)
* _Inflict Megalomania:_ Major Transform 1d6 (Normal person into megalomaniac: Adds Psych Complication Megalomania Common/Total) (10 Active Points); Extra Time (20 Minutes, -2 1/2), OAF Immobile Durable Expendable (Difficult to obtain new Focus; -2 1/4)

**Active Cost:** 107, **Real Cost:** 18
