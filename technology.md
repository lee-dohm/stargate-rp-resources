# Technology

## Control Crystals

Control crystals are crystals designed to regulate various functions in advanced technology. Most spacefaring races make use of crystal technology in some form.

## Naquadah

[Naquadah](http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Naquadah) is the super-dense mineral that not only makes stargate travel possible but underlies almost all advanced technology in the Stargate universe. It comes in several forms:

* **Raw Naquadah** &mdash; Unprocessed naquadah that must be purified to be used
* **Refined Naquadah** &mdash; Basic usable naquadah
* **Liquid Naquadah** &mdash; Liquified naquadah used in some smaller cells mostly to power weapons such as the [Ma'Tok Staff](#matok-staff)
* **Heavy Liquid Naquadah** &mdash; Concentrated liquid naquadah used in larger weapons
* **Weapons-grade Naquadah** &mdash; Naquadah in its purest form
* **Naquadria** &mdash; A radioactive form of naquadah that can be used as an enormous power source but is highly unstable

## Stargates and the Stargate System

Stargates provide point-to-point near-instantaneous faster-than-light travel, typically between two worlds. Any stargate can connect to any other stargate so long as there is sufficient power available and one knows the address of the destination gate. It does this by creating a stable wormhole that will allow matter to pass only from the source gate to the destination gate but will allow electromagnetism, gravity, and possibly other forms of energy to flow both directions.

A gate has 39 symbols on it. A gate address is made up of 6 symbols for the destination portion. This means there are 3,262,623 possible addresses in the Milky Way gate system.

**Stargate:** Teleportation 100m with 32x Extra Mass 125pts; MegaScale (1,000ly scale) +5, AoE 4m radius +0.25, Constant +0.5, Usable by Others +0.25; Gate -0.5 (_see:_ 6E1 301), OIF (Stargate and DHD), Immovable, Extremely Difficult to Obtain -2.5 -- **Active Cost:** 875, **Real Cost:** 219

### Transport Rings

Transport rings are a short-range version of the stargate technology. Their range is enough to go from a planet's surface into orbit or from one starship to another in relative proximity.

**Transport Rings:** Teleportation 100m with 8x Extra Mass 115pts; MegaScale (1,000km scale) +1.75, AoE 2m radius +0.25, Usable by Others +0.25; Gate -0.5 (_see:_ 6E1 301), OIF (Transport rings), Immovable, Difficult to Obtain -2 -- **Active Cost:** 431, **Real Cost:** 123
