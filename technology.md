## Naquadah

[Naquadah](http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Naquadah) is the super-dense mineral that not only makes stargate travel possible but underlies almost all advanced technology in the Stargate universe. It comes in several forms:

* Raw Naquadah
* Refined Naquadah
* Liquid Naquadah
* Heavy Liquid Naquadah
* Weapons-grade Naquadah
* Naquadria

## Stargates and the Stargate System

Stargates provide point-to-point near-instantaneous faster-than-light travel, typically between two worlds. Any stargate can connect to any other stargate so long as there is sufficient power available and one knows the address of the destination gate. It does this by creating a stable wormhole that will allow matter to pass only from the source gate to the destination gate but will allow some forms of energy to flow both directions.

39 symbols, 6 symbols to make up the destination portion of an address = 3,262,623 possible addresses in the Milky Way gate system.

### Transport Rings

Transport rings are a short-range version of the stargate technology. Their range is enough to go from a planet's surface into orbit, but not much further.
