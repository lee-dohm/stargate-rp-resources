# Technology

## Control Crystals

Control crystals are crystals designed to regulate various functions in advanced technology. Most spacefaring races make use of crystal technology in some form.

## Naquadah

[Naquadah](http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Naquadah) is the super-dense mineral that not only makes stargate travel possible but underlies almost all advanced technology in the Stargate universe. It comes in several forms:

* **Raw Naquadah** &mdash; Unprocessed naquadah that must be purified to be used
* **Refined Naquadah** &mdash; Basic usable naquadah
* **Liquid Naquadah** &mdash; Liquified naquadah used in some smaller cells mostly to power weapons such as the [Ma'Tok Staff](#matok-staff)
* **Heavy Liquid Naquadah** &mdash; Concentrated liquid naquadah used in larger weapons
* **Weapons-grade Naquadah** &mdash; Naquadah in its purest form
* **Naquadria** &mdash; A radioactive form of naquadah that can be used as an enormous power source but is highly unstable

## Stargates and the Stargate System

Stargates provide point-to-point near-instantaneous faster-than-light travel, typically between two worlds. Any stargate can connect to any other stargate so long as there is sufficient power available and one knows the address of the destination gate. It does this by creating a stable wormhole that will allow matter to pass only from the source gate to the destination gate but will allow some forms of energy to flow both directions.

39 symbols, 6 symbols to make up the destination portion of an address = 3,262,623 possible addresses in the Milky Way gate system.

**Stargate:** Teleportation 100m with 32x Extra Mass 130pts, MegaScale (1,000 ly scale) +5, AoE 4m radius +0.25, Constant +0.5, Gate -0.25; OIF (Stargate and DHD), Immovable, Extremely Difficult to Obtain -2.5 -- **Active Cost:** 844, **Real Cost:** 225

### Transport Rings

Transport rings are a short-range version of the stargate technology. Their range is enough to go from a planet's surface into orbit or from one starship to another in relative proximity.
